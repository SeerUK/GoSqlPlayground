# Go SQL Playground

Messing around using MySQL with Go. This project is purely a learning exercise for me, looking at 
how databases can be used in Go.

## Goals

Here are some of the basic goals of this project:

* [ ] Basics of querying.
* [ ] Reading into structs.
* [ ] Simple "up-only", file-based migrations.
